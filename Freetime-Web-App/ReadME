Bad news..... Github would not let me upload the folder "node_modules". It is complaining that it was too many files to upload. This folder is needed to help make the app run. You don't have to create this folder yourself it is automatically done using the npm packaging manager. npm is a tool used in the command line that will help us install modules for our app quick and easy. It is straight forward, all you have to do is (in terminal) cd into the Freetime-Web-App directory and run the command: npm install MODULENAME 
I'm pretty sure it is automatically installed at the same time you install NodeJS. (if not the website is listed below)

Website References (will update periodically)
   NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/
   npm    - https://www.npmjs.com/
   
I guess we can use this file as forum where we can post ask and answer questions (so that everyone gets to see).
